  "notes": "Version 1.2.3 - Screen Sharing Stability & Performance Fixes. Critical bug fixes: Fixed major screen sharing issues causing robot voice, connection glitches, and bandwidth spikes. Implemented sequential WebRTC negotiation queue to prevent concurrent offer creation that was overwhelming network connections. Improved track replacement timing to eliminate black screen flickering during screen share transitions. Enhanced audio track management with better screen share audio detection using track labels, ensuring microphone audio always remains enabled. Added proper connection state validation and error handling during renegotiation. Screen sharing now works smoothly without affecting voice quality or connection stability. All fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing voice channels.",
