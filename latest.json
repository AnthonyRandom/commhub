  "notes": "Version 1.1.8 - Real-Time Update System Fix. Fixed critical WebSocket connection issues preventing real-time updates for friends list, DMs, server members, channel events, and voice channel status. Implemented proper 'ready' event emission on all connections/reconnections, added missing friend presence and DM thread listeners, fixed friend status update handling, and future-proofed for @mention notifications by enabling background channel updates. All features now work in real-time without requiring app refresh or page reload.",
